                <h2 id="unit1">Unit 1: Society State and Polity in India</h2>
                <p>This unit covers topics related to the formation and structure of the state, society, and social institutions in ancient India.</p>

                <h3 id="unit1-origin">Origin of the State & Theories</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The state is an <span class="highlight-tertiary">association of people governing a defined territory</span>.</li>
                    <li>Key elements: <span class="highlight-secondary">population, territory, authority, and sovereignty</span>.</li>
                    <li>Ancient thinkers like Kautilya discussed the origin of the state.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-tertiary">Four main theories:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Evolutionary Theory:</span> State evolved from family/clan structures, starting from anarchy, progressing through agriculture to settled life, with assemblies (Sabha and Samiti) playing a role. Mentioned in the Atharva Veda.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Force Theory:</span> State formed by the stronger dominating the weaker, seen in early Aryan clan conflicts. A strong warrior led the clan and later became king.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Mystical/Divine Theory:</span> Society and the state were created by God, with the king as his representative, ruling by divine will.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Contract Theory:</span> State formed through a contract between the king and his subjects or representatives. Referenced in Brahmanical texts, Kautilya's Arthashastra, and Buddhist sources.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="unit1-stages">Stages of State Formation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight-tertiary">Six main stages</span> of ancient Indian polity:
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Tribal military democracy:</span> Early stage based on hunting with tribal assemblies, not stable.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Break-up of tribal polity:</span> Conflicts arose, chiefs were aided by Brahmins, leading to the beginning of taxes and classes.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Full-fledged state formation:</span> Emergence of large territorial monarchies with standing armies and organized revenue collection.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Maurya phase:</span> Bureaucratic centralisation based on economic expansion and guided by Kautilya's Arthashastra.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Decentralised Administration:</span> Rise of towns, feudatories, and military elements.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Gupta Period (Proto-Feudal Polity):</span> Land grants became important in the political structure formed by Gupta feudatories.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="unit1-kingship">Kingship & Council of Ministers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The King was the <span class="highlight-secondary">most important figure</span> in the polity. Kautilya's Saptanga theory describes the King (Swami) as the head of the state.</li>
                    <li>King's duties included protecting life, property, and customs, punishing external aggression, ensuring fair inheritance, and protecting the poor.</li>
                    <li>The Council of Ministers (Amatya) was a vital organ, and the King needed its consent. Ministers were appointed based on <span class="highlight-tertiary">wisdom, purity, bravery, and loyalty</span>. The council size varied from 7 to 37 ministers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="unit1-political-welfare">Political Ideas & Welfare Society</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early political science was known as <span class="highlight-tertiary">Rajadharma</span>, later called <span class="highlight-tertiary">Rajniti-sutra or Nitishastra</span>.</li>
                    <li>Politics was discussed by Brahmins, Jains, and Buddhists.</li>
                    <li>A <span class="highlight-secondary">welfare society</span> aims for the happiness and prosperity of individuals in a community and guarantees collective social care. Kautilya's concept of the state in his Saptanga theory was holistic.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="unit1-saptanga">The Seven Limbs of the State (Kautilya's Saptanga)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight-tertiary">Essential components</span> of the state, engaging Artha and Dharma:
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Swami (The Ruler):</span> Brave, learned monarch, native of the soil, making appointments and supervising.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Amatya (The Minister):</span> Council advising the King, collecting taxes, developing areas.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Janapada (The Population):</span> Fertile territory and people loyal, hardworking, and tax-paying.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Durga (The Fortified Capital):</span> Sufficient forts for security and storage.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Kosha (The Treasury):</span> Essential finance from taxes, vital for state functions and war.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Danda (The Army):</span> Disciplined military for security, well-trained and equipped.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlight-primary">Mitra (Ally and Friend):</span> Friendly relations, old and new, providing help and adding to state power.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
